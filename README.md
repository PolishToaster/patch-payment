# Patch Payment Plugin
This plugin allows you to check the required payment for a farmer to look after your crops with a new menu item 'Check'.

### Features
- Adds a new menu option when right-clicking on viable farming items (seeds, saplings, etc.) that displays the required payment items for a farmer to look after your patch
- Adds a toggleable feature that gives you the ability to check an item's payment while in the bank interface
- If you don't like having an extra menu option you can set the item's 'Examine' option to display the payment details instead in the plugin settings
